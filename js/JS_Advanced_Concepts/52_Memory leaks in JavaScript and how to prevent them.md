- Memory leaks can lead to <strong>poor performance, slow loading times and crashes in web applications.</strong>

- A memory leak occurs <strong>when a Javascript program holds onto references to objects that are no longer needed</strong>, preventing the garbage collector from freeing up memory.

- This can cause the amount of memory used by the program to grow over time, eventually leading to performance issues.

- To prevent memory leaks, it's important to understand how Javascript manages memory and what causes leaks.

- Javascript is a <strong>garbage-collected language, meaning that the browser auotmatically frees up the memory </strong>that is no longer needed by the program

- However <strong>if a program holds onto references to objects that are no longer needed</strong>, the garbage collector cannot free up the memory, leading to a memory leak

There are several common causes of memory leaks in Javascript. Below are the few of them:

---

- <strong>Global Variables:</strong>Global variables <strong>persist for the life of the program and can cause memory leaks if they hold onto references</strong> to objects that are no longer needed.

- To prevent this, it's <strong>best to use local variables </strong>whenever possible and to <strong>explicity set global variable to null when they are no longer needed</strong>.

---

- <strong>Event Handlers:</strong> Event handlers are often used to bind functions to events, such as click events or mouse events.

- If an event handler holds onto references to objects that are no longer needed, this can cause a memory leak.

- To prevent this, it's important to <strong>unbind event handlers</strong> when they are no longer needed.

---

<strong>Circular references</strong>: Circular references occur when <strong>two or more objects reference each other, </strong>creating a cylce of references that can't be broken.

- This can prevent the garbage collector from freeing up memory and cause a memory leak.

- To prevent this, it's important to <strong>break circular references by explicitly setting object references to null</strong> when they are no longer needed.

```js
//Example of Circular reference

const obj1 = {}
const obj2 = {}

obj1.ref = obj2
obj2.ref = obj1
```

Above can lead to unexpected behavior, <strong>such as infinite loops and cause memory leaks</strong> if the objects are not propely garbage collected.

To avoid circular references, it's important to always be mindful of the <strong>relationships between objects in your code and to ensure that objects do not reference each other in a way that creates a loop.</strong>

- For example, <strong>you can use weak references to break ciruclar references</strong>, or you can avoid circular references altogether by structuring your code in a different way.

##### Example of how to prevent a memory leak caused by a global variable:

```js
// This global variable persist for the life

let data = []

function fetchData() {
  data = getDataFromServer()
}

// To prevent memory leak, we need to set the global variable to null when it is no longer needed

function clearData() {
  data = null
}
```

##### Example of how to prevent a memory leak caused by an event handler:

```js
// this event handler holds onto references to objects that are no longer needed and will cause a memory leak if not unbound.

document.addEventListener("click", fucntion(){
    //Do something
})

// To prevent the memory leak, we need to unbind the event handler when it is no longer needed

document.removeEventListener("click", function(){
    // Do something
})
```
