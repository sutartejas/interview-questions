### 14. Context vs Scope

**Scope**

- Scope is a <ins>**_function_**</ins> based
- Scope means what is the variable axis of a function when it is invoked and what is in the variable environment.

**Context**

- Context, on the other hand, is more about <ins>**object**</ins> based.
- Context says **_what's the value of the this keyword_**, which is a reference to the object that owns that current executing code.

**`Context` is most often determined by <ins>_how a function is invoked with the value of this keyword_</ins> and `scope` refers to the <ins>visibility of variables.</ins>**
