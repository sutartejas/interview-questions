1. Please have a look at my skills section
2. Have a look at my title, about summary description, certifications I did (relevant to my job profile)
3. Add featured Links (topmate links, add resume PDF(I removed), add a GitHub link)
4. Pass the Skill quiz (No.1 priority), you will see (check âœ…) symbol.
5. Recommendations section (get them added)
6. Your profile photo (should not be a selfie and it has to be in a blur background). 
 - It should be as much professional as it should be.

- Similarly there are a lot of things that actually matters
- If you have time (there is one YouTube video related to this)
