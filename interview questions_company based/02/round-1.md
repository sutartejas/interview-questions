- ##### Find the repeated elements and output them as array


```javascript
function findRepeatedElements(arr) {
    let seen = new Set();
    let duplicates = new Set();

    for (let num of arr) {
        if (seen.has(num)) {
            duplicates.add(num);
        } else {
            seen.add(num);
        }
    }

    return [...duplicates];
}
```

Let's break this down:

1. We use two `Set` objects. `seen` keeps track of numbers we've come across, and `duplicates` keeps track of numbers we've seen more than once.

2. For each `num` in `arr`, we check if it's in the `seen` set. If it is, it's a duplicate, and we add it to the `duplicates` set. Otherwise, we add it to the `seen` set.

3. Finally, we return the `duplicates` set as an array.

This approach has the advantage of using just one loop, making it potentially more efficient, and the use of Sets ensures that the `duplicates` will only contain unique values.

- ##### Return the largest difference of indices of given character if there is a duplicate else return -1

```javascript
function largestIndexDifference(s, char) {
    let minIndex = null;
    let maxIndex = null;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === char) {
            if (minIndex === null) {
                minIndex = i;
            }
            maxIndex = i;
        }
    }

    if (minIndex !== null && maxIndex !== null && minIndex !== maxIndex) {
        return maxIndex - minIndex;
    }

    return -1;
}

// Example usage:
const str = "hello there";
const char = "e";
console.log(largestIndexDifference(str, char)); // This would return 9
```

- Browser cache
The best browser cache strategy depends on the specific needs of your website or web application. However, a common and effective strategy is to use a combination of caching mechanisms to balance performance and freshness of content. Here's a general approach:

1. **Browser Caching**: Leverage browser caching by setting appropriate HTTP headers. This allows browsers to store static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript locally for a specified period. You can control the cache duration using the `Cache-Control` and `Expires` headers.

2. **Content Versioning**: Append version numbers or timestamps to the filenames of your assets (e.g., `styles.css?v=1.2` or `script.js?timestamp=123456`). This ensures that when you make changes to these assets, the browser recognizes them as new files, thus avoiding caching issues.

3. **Cache Busting**: Use cache-busting techniques like changing filenames or query parameters when deploying new versions of your website. This forces the browser to retrieve the latest version of the assets.

4. **CDN Usage**: If you're using a Content Delivery Network (CDN), it often comes with built-in caching capabilities. Configure it to suit your needs, considering cache expiration and purging strategies.

5. **Server-Side Caching**: Implement server-side caching mechanisms like opcode caching (e.g., APC, OpCache) for PHP or reverse proxy caching (e.g., Varnish) to reduce server load and improve response times.

6. **Conditional Requests**: Implement conditional requests using the `ETag` and `Last-Modified` headers. This allows the browser to check with the server whether the cached resource is still valid before requesting a new one.

7. **Cache-Control Headers**: Use appropriate values for the `Cache-Control` header to define caching behavior. For example, you can set `public` or `private` cache, specify `max-age` for cache duration, and use `no-cache` or `no-store` directives when needed.

8. **Gzip Compression**: Compress your assets before sending them to the browser. This reduces their size and speeds up loading times.

Remember that while caching improves performance, it's important to strike a balance. Overly aggressive caching can lead to users seeing outdated content. Regularly monitor your website's performance and test different caching strategies to find the best approach for your specific use case.

- Caption to image in html
To add a caption to an image in HTML, you can use the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements. Here's an example:

```html
<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
  <figcaption>This is a beautiful sunset over the mountains.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

Replace `"image.jpg"` with the actual path to your image and modify the caption text accordingly. The `<figcaption>` element provides a semantic way to associate a caption with an image.
