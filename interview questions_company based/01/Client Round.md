#### Practical:

##### Given a trading application and there are two lists- one list is for getAllStocks- second list is for saving the stocks- Whenever a user clicks on a specific stock, it should navigate to that page.

q1) How can you achieve above functionality?
q2) What is the scope of Reusable components in those two lists ?
q3) If a user purchase a stock, how can you update his purchases right away (without reloading or clicking on back button) ?
q4) How can you minimize the API requests using Redux ?
