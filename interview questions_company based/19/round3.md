Q1. Short introduction and previous projects
Q2. React Router
Q3. How to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the content of the application?? Explain private routing with code implementation.
Q4. Error Boundary - Its uses and how to build an error boundary component ?? The lifecycles methods used to build the error boundary component.
Q5. There are 3 components Parent1, child1 and child2. If an error occurs in child2 then an error message should be  shown for child2 component only and rest of the component should render as it is without any error message. Similarly for child1,The error message will be completely different  from child2. We need to write the code for this using ErrorBoundry Component??
Q6. useEffect and its uses.
Q7. Some programs to check the useEffect concepts like how to make API calls on page load.
Q8. Can we make API call outside useEffect?? What happens if we do so?
Q9. Write a JS program to sum up the digits of the numbers. For example:- 2576 -> 2 + 5 + 7 + 6 -> 20 -> 2 + 0 -> 2 (Interviewer was expecting a one liner solution for this).
Q10.Write a program to remove everything except even numbers from the array but you can not use a new array.
    Ex: I/p:- [1,2,3,a,d,f,"#",4,6,4,4,")","("] => [2,4,6,4,4]( Interviewer was expecting a one liner solution for this)
Q11.How react works behind the scene?? How it renders the UI?? Reconciliation, Virtual DOM and diffing algorithm?? 
Q12.Context API and scenario based question. Create two component - Parent and child. Parent has a state num and child has a set of buttons to increment and decrement the num. You need to make it working without using props. Interviewer wanted me to write down all the react components for this.   
Q13.Tell me all the topics you know in React and what all you don't know/Learning as of now.
Q14. Implement a counter component(one Parent, two childs with decrement and increment functions) and optimize it
Q15. Write code to use React Context API and some follow up questions.
Q16. Tell me the effects you have used till date. Differences between useCallback and useMemo
Q17. ES6 features and related concepts.
 
Note: We need to write the programs in Notepad only and any syntax highlighting editor is not allowed.
